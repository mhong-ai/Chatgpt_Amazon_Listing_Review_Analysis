# Chatgpt_Amazon_Listing_Review_Analysis 

This tool is designed to analyze customer reviews and determine their sentiment (positive or negative) as well as extract key words from each review.

In this example, we utilize a dataset of customer reviews from Amazon listings, which (the whole datasets) can be obtained by using extensions like Helium 10. Once the dataset is formatted correctly, it can be seamlessly integrated into our tool for thorough analysis.

This tool can be used in gaining insights about customers and enhancing product development.

*Note: this is an ongoing project.
